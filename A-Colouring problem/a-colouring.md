# A-Colouring
**Problem**: Given a graph G = (V, E), a proper coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices of the graph such that adjacent vertices receive different colors. Furthermore, if we have the property that for each set of vertices colored with color i, the combined neighborhood of these vertices contains all other colors, i.e., if Ci ⊆ V(G) is the set of vertices that received color i, then for every color i, the neighborhood N(Ci) union with any Cj is non-empty for every color j, where j ≠ i. We call this type of coloring an A-coloring.

We want to determine the largest number of colors possible to properly color a given input graph and ensure that the obtained coloring is an A-coloring.
