Assignment 01 | DCC035 - Operational Research | March 2024, Federal University of Minas Gerais

### Modelling optimization problems
In this assignment the students were meant to model 5 problems in the `Julia` programming language, to be solved by the HiGHS linear programming optimizer.

### What is linear programming for?
Here's what [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/wiki/linear-programming/) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20240602224450/https://brilliant.org/wiki/linear-programming/)) says about it: *Linear programming can be used to solve a problem when the goal of the problem is to maximize some value and there is a linear system of inequalities that defines the constraints on the problem.*

In other words, we can get many types of real-world problems and then model them mathematically into linear equations, such that existing solvers may optimize their result. Many of these problems can have large amounts of variables and restrictions, but solving them this way can give us pretty good results and in reasonable time.
